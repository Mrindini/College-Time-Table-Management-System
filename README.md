# College Time Table Management System 

## Project Overview

 College Time Table Management System in Python using Flask, a web framework. This code provides a foundation for the features you outlined, including user roles, schedule creation, automated conflict resolution, and announcements. Note that this example uses SQLite as the database for simplicity.

Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:

. Python (3.7+)
. Flask
. Flask-SQLAlchemy
. Flask-Login

You can install the required packages with pip:

pip install Flask Flask-SQLAlchemy Flask-Login

## Requirements and Features

Code Implementation
1.  app.py: Main application file
2. models.py: Database models (included in app.py for simplicity).

You can separate the models into this file if desired, but for a small project, it's fine to keep it simple.

3. forms.py: Create forms using Flask-WTF (not implemented in the code above but recommended for larger applications).

4. HTML Templates: Here are some example templates you can create in the templates folder.

index.html
login.html
schedule.html
announcements.html
attendance.html: This can be implemented later with specific attendance tracking feature

Running the Application
Initialize the Database:
The first time you run the app, it will create the database and tables. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Access the Application:
Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to access the application.

User Authentication:
For this basic example, you will need to manually add users to the database using an SQLite database browser
